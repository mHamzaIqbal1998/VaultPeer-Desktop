## 🛠️ Architecture & Decision Log

### 1. Desktop Framework Selection

**Decision**: Tauri (Rust + WebView2) over Electron or native WPF/WinUI.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Electron**: Rejected due to large bundle size (~150MB vs Tauri's ~5MB) and higher memory usage
- **WPF/WinUI**: Rejected due to slower development velocity and lack of cross-platform potential
- **Flutter**: Rejected due to FFI complexity for Rust crypto libraries

**Rationale**: 
- Rust provides memory safety and native performance for cryptography
- React enables code sharing with mobile app (logic patterns, types)
- WebView2 is pre-installed on Windows 10/11 (no extra download)
- Single binary deployment with small footprint

### 2. Cryptographic Engine

**Decision**: Pure Rust implementation using `keepass-rs` + `argon2` crates.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **WASM-compiled kdbxweb**: Rejected - slower than native Rust
- **Windows CNG (Cryptography Next Generation)**: Rejected - limits cipher flexibility

**Rationale**:
- `keepass-rs` provides native KDBX 4.0 support
- `argon2` crate provides memory-hard KDF (same algorithm as mobile)
- Rust's memory safety prevents crypto implementation vulnerabilities
- Easy integration with Tauri's command system

### 3. Biometric Authentication

**Decision**: Windows Hello via `windows` crate (Win32 API) with DPAPI fallback.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Primary: Windows Hello (Fingerprint, Face, PIN)
- Fallback: DPAPI for credential encryption when Hello unavailable
- Store encrypted master password using `CryptProtectData`

### 4. Global Hotkeys

**Decision**: `global-hotkey` crate with Tauri integration.

**Rationale**:
- Auto-type requires system-wide hotkey listening
- Must work even when app is not focused
- Register Ctrl+Alt+A for auto-type, Ctrl+Shift+A for selective auto-type

### 5. File System Access

**Decision**: Direct file system access via Rust `std::fs` with atomic writes.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Windows File Picker (COM)**: Still used for UI, but actual I/O through Rust
- **Memory-mapped files**: Overkill for typical KDBX sizes

**Rationale**:
- KeePass-compatible atomic save (write to temp, rename)
- No sandbox limitations like mobile platforms
- Direct cloud folder monitoring for external sync detection

### 6. State Management

**Decision**: Zustand on frontend, with Rust-backed persistence for secrets.

**Rationale**:
- Familiar pattern from mobile app
- SecureStore equivalent: Windows DPAPI for small secrets
- Thread-safe Rust backend for concurrent operations

**Deliverable**: Feature-complete entry management matching KeePass DX. ✅

---

### Phase 5: Password Generator & OTP

**Focus**: Secure password generation and TOTP 2FA support.

- [x] Implement password generator (Web Crypto, rejection-sampled, in `lib/passwordGenerator.ts`):
  - [x] Character set selection (upper, lower, digits, symbols)
  - [x] Length slider (8-128)
  - [x] Entropy estimation with visual bar (`passwordEntropyBits` / `entropyStrength`)
  - [x] Exclude ambiguous characters option
  - [x] Pronounceable passphrase mode (Diceware-style, 256-word `lib/wordlist.ts`)
- [x] Build password generator UI:
  - [x] Standalone tool window (`PasswordGenerator.tsx`, opens from title bar / Ctrl+G)
  - [x] Integrated in entry form (`PasswordGeneratorPopover`)
  - [x] History of generated passwords (session-only, `stores/generatorStore.ts`)
- [x] Implement TOTP support (native Rust `otp.rs`, verified against RFC 6238 vectors):
  - [x] TOTP code generation (RFC 6238) (`generate_totp` command + dynamic truncation)
  - [x] QR code scanning via camera integration (`QrScanner.tsx`, jsQR; + image-file fallback)
  - [x] Manual secret entry (`OtpEditor`, base32 or `otpauth://` URI)
  - [x] Visual countdown with progress bar (`OtpCard` countdown ring)
  - [x] Copy OTP to clipboard
  - [x] Support for SHA1/SHA256/SHA512 algorithms
  - [x] Custom period and digit settings
- [x] Add OTP display card to entry detail view (`OtpCard` in `EntryDetail`)

**Deliverable**: Password generator and OTP support fully functional. ✅

---

### Phase 6: Search, Clipboard & Auto-Type

**Focus**: Discovery features and Windows integration.

- [x] Implement search:
  - [x] Global search across all fields (native Rust fuzzy matcher in `search.rs` over title/username/URL/notes/tags/custom field names+values; recycle bin excluded; 6 unit tests)
  - [x] Fuzzy matching with highlighting (substring + subsequence scoring with start/word-boundary bonuses; match highlight in `SearchModal`)
  - [x] Search-as-you-type with debouncing (150ms debounce in `SearchModal`)
  - [x] Advanced filters (group, tag, URL) (current-group scope toggle + tag chips in the modal; `SearchFilters`; URL is a first-class searchable field)
- [x] Build search UI:
  - [x] Search bar in title bar (Ctrl+K) (`SearchModal.tsx`, opens from the title-bar search button or Ctrl+K)
  - [x] Search results with context snippets (group breadcrumb + matched-field label & snippet per hit)
  - [x] Quick navigation to entry (`openEntry` reveals the group then selects the entry; full ↑/↓/Enter/Esc keyboard control)
- [x] Implement clipboard operations:
  - [x] Copy username/password with hotkeys (Ctrl+B username, Ctrl+C password on the selected entry; defers to real text selections / inputs)
  - [x] Auto-clear clipboard after timeout (`lib/clipboard.ts`, 30s default, only wipes our own value; live countdown pill `ClipboardIndicator`)
  - [x] Protected clipboard (exclude from managers) (native Windows `clipboard.rs`: `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing` + history/cloud opt-out; Web Clipboard fallback off-Windows)
- [x] Implement auto-type:
  - [x] Global hotkey registration (Ctrl+Alt+A) (`tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`; + Ctrl+Alt+P for selective/password-only. Hotkey modifiers are released before injecting so an injected Tab isn't read as Alt+Tab.)
  - [x] Window title matching (`search::match_entry_for_window` — longest title / URL-host substring match against the foreground window)
  - [x] Auto-type sequence (token+literal parser in `autotype.rs`; supports `{USERNAME}`,`{PASSWORD}`,`{TITLE}`,`{URL}`,`{TOTP}`,`{TAB}`,`{ENTER}`; keystrokes via `enigo`; 4 unit tests). Default `{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}` does **not** auto-submit; add `{ENTER}` via a custom sequence to submit.
  - [x] Custom sequences per entry (read from an "AutoType Sequence" custom field, falling back to the default)
  - [x] Target window selection dialog (in-app "Auto-Type" action on the entry detail hides the window so the previously-active app regains focus, then types into it)
- [x] Add system tray menu:
  - [x] Quick access to recent entries (dynamic recent-entries section rebuilt via `set_tray_recent`; clicking one copies that entry's password)
  - [x] Lock database
  - [x] Quit application

**Deliverable**: Complete Windows integration with search, clipboard, and auto-type. ✅

> Note: keystroke injection (auto-type) and clipboard-history exclusion are inherently Windows-native and run only on the Windows V1 target; they compile everywhere (non-Windows uses safe stubs that fall back to the Web Clipboard API / report "Windows only"). The Windows FFI (`enigo` + `windows` crate) was verified to compile against the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target.

---

### Phase 7: Settings & Preferences

**Focus**: Application configuration and customization.

- [x] Build settings architecture:
  - [x] Rust-based settings storage (JSON file in AppData) (`settings.rs` → `settings.json` in `app_config_dir`, `SettingsState` Tauri-managed, atomic write; frontend `settingsStore` mirrors it)
  - [x] Settings migration/versioning (`version` field + `migrate()`; `serde(default)` backfills new fields so older files upgrade losslessly; 4 unit tests)
- [x] Implement Database Settings tab (`SettingsPanel` → Database tab; edits the open vault and re-saves to re-encrypt):
  - [x] Default KDF and cipher selection (open-DB editor via `get_db_settings`/`update_db_settings`; **plus** "Defaults for new databases" editor persisting `defaultCreateOptions`, consumed by `CreateDatabaseDialog`)
  - [x] KDF parameter tuning (rounds, memory, parallelism)
  - [x] KDF benchmark tool ("Calculate for 1.0s") (`kdf_benchmark` command → `crypto::benchmark_kdf_iterations`, times one Argon2 pass and scales)
  - [x] Compression setting (GZip/None)
  - [x] Recycle bin configuration (`db.meta.recyclebin_enabled`)
  - [x] History settings (max items, max size) (`db.meta.history_max_items`/`history_max_size`)
  - [x] Database maintenance (cleanup) (`db_maintenance` → `database::maintenance_cleanup` trims per-entry history to the item/size limits; reports what was pruned)
- [x] Implement App Settings tab:
  - [x] Theme selection (Dark/Light/System) (segmented control → `themeStore` + persisted in settings)
  - [x] Auto-lock timeout (1 min - 1 hour, or Never) (idle-timer in `App.tsx` on `autoLockSeconds`; resets on any input, locks on elapse)
  - [x] Clipboard clear timeout (10s - 5 min, or Never) (`lib/clipboard.ts` reads `clipboardClearSeconds`)
  - [x] Minimize to tray behavior (`minimizeToTray`; the Rust window-close handler reads `SettingsState` — hides to tray when on, quits when off)
  - [x] Start with Windows toggle (`autostart.rs` HKCU `…\Run` registry entry; Windows-only with stub elsewhere; verified to compile against `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)
  - [x] Default password generator settings (`generator` defaults; seed `PasswordGenerator`)
  - [x] Keyboard shortcut customization (`ShortcutBindings` + `lib/shortcuts.ts`; capture/match accelerators; `App.tsx` & `MainLayout` handlers honour them. Global auto-type hotkeys remain fixed/native)
- [x] Implement Security Settings:
  - [x] Windows Hello / biometric setup (`biometric.rs`: DPAPI-protected master password + `UserConsentVerifier` consent gate; enroll/forget in Security tab, "Unlock with Windows Hello" on the unlock screen; Windows-only, FFI verified against `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)
  - [x] Emergency export (`export.rs` CSV + XML of the decrypted vault, recycle-bin excluded; `export_database` command + unencrypted-warning UI; 3 unit tests)
  - [x] Clear all recent files history (`vaultStore.clearRecentFiles` from the Security tab)

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive settings matching mobile app capabilities. ✅

> Note: settings persist to `settings.json` and quick-unlock credentials to
> `quickunlock.json`, both under the per-user app-config dir. Auto-lock,
> minimize-to-tray, clipboard-clear, default generator/create options, and
> custom in-app shortcuts are all wired to live settings. The Windows-native
> pieces (Start-with-Windows registry entry, DPAPI + Windows Hello quick-unlock)
> compile everywhere — non-Windows builds use safe stubs that report the feature
> is Windows-only — and the Windows FFI was type-checked against the
> `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target.

---

### Phase 8: P2P Synchronization (WebRTC)

**Focus**: Peer-to-peer vault synchronization between devices.

- [x] Research and select WebRTC Rust implementation:
  - [x] Evaluate `webrtc-rs` vs custom data channel implementation (**Decision: run the WebRTC transport in the WebView's native, audited WebRTC stack on the frontend (`lib/webrtc.ts`) rather than the ~300-crate `webrtc-rs`.** This keeps the single-binary footprint small, shares one JS sync protocol with the React-based mobile app, and lets Rust own only what must never hit the wire in the clear — the **encrypted** snapshot and the merge.)
- [x] Implement signaling client (`lib/webrtc.ts` `SyncSession`):
  - [x] WebSocket connection to signaling server (JSON relay protocol documented in `webrtc.ts`; URL configured in Settings → Sync)
  - [x] Room creation/joining (`syncStore.createRoom`/`joinRoom`; the peer already in the room becomes the WebRTC offerer to avoid offer glare)
  - [x] QR code generation for room IDs (`lib/qr.ts`: `buildSyncInvite` → `vaultpeer://sync?room=…&server=…`, rendered to SVG via the bundled `qrcode`; shown in the active-session panel)
- [x] Implement WebRTC peer connection:
  - [x] RTCPeerConnection setup (`ensurePeerConnection`, configured with the user's ICE servers)
  - [x] Data channel negotiation (`createDataChannel` on the offerer / `ondatachannel` on the answerer; `binaryType = "arraybuffer"`)
  - [x] ICE candidate handling (`onicecandidate` relays via signaling; `addIceCandidate` on receipt)
  - [x] Connection state management (`onconnectionstatechange`; `SyncStatus` state machine: connecting → waiting → negotiating → syncing → done/error)
- [x] Implement sync protocol:
  - [x] Metadata exchange (timestamps, checksums) (`sync_fingerprint` → `VaultFingerprint` with `latestModified` + FNV-1a `checksum`; peers swap `hello` and skip transfer when checksums match)
  - [x] File chunking for large databases (16 KiB chunks with `bufferedAmount` backpressure; framed by `snap-start`/binary chunks/`snap-end`)
  - [x] Conflict detection and resolution (native KeePass `Database::merge` via the `_merge` feature — UUID-based, newer-modification-wins, history-preserving; `sync::merge_snapshot` returns created/updated/relocated/deleted counts + warnings)
  - [x] Progress indication (`SyncProgress` sent/received byte counters → progress bars in `SyncPanel`)
- [x] Build sync UI:
  - [x] Sync mode selection (Offline/Network) (`SyncPanel` segmented toggle; Offline tears down any session)
  - [x] Server URL configuration (Settings → Sync tab, persisted in `AppSettings.sync.signalingUrl`)
  - [x] Room management (create, join, leave) (`SyncPanel`; join accepts a room code or a scanned/pasted invite link)
  - [x] Connected peers list with status (peer-connected/waiting indicator + live status chip; two-party rooms)
  - [x] QR code scanner for joining (reuses the existing `QrScanner`/jsQR component; `parseSyncInvite` decodes the invite)
  - [x] Sync status indicator in title bar (`SyncStatus` — colored status dot + spinning icon + live transfer **percentage** over the sync icon, opens the panel)
  - [x] Remembered room + auto-sync (the joined/created room persists in `AppSettings.sync.room`/`autoSync`; opening a vault auto-rejoins it via `syncStore.autoStart`, and saving the vault auto-pushes to the connected peer via `syncStore.pushNow` → `SyncSession.pushUpdate`, mirroring the mobile node's push-on-change)
- [x] Implement ICE server configuration:
  - [x] Default STUN servers (`SyncConfig::default` seeds `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`; mirrored in the frontend defaults)
  - [x] Custom TURN server support (Settings → Sync: add/remove servers with optional TURN username/credential)

**Deliverable**: P2P sync working between desktop and mobile app. ✅

> Note: the WebRTC transport + WebSocket signaling run in the WebView (native,
> cross-platform), so no `webrtc-rs` dependency is added and nothing
> Windows-specific is introduced. The desktop speaks the **exact** VaultPeer
> signaling + sync protocol used by the mobile app and the storage `Server-node`
> (`WEBRTC-SERVERS/`): `{type:"join", roomId}` + `announce`/`senderId`/`targetId`
> handshake (greater id offers), JSON data-channel messages, and the base64
> `file_chunk_start`/`file_chunk`/`file_chunk_end` transfer with a SHA-256
> integrity hash, plus the `metadata_query`/`metadata_info`/`pull_request`/
> `pull_response`/`push_request` last-writer-wins flow and the app-level
> `ping`/`pong` heartbeat. The vault only ever crosses the wire as the
> **encrypted** `.kdbx` (over the DTLS-encrypted data channel); the decrypted
> database never leaves the Rust backend. On receipt it is merged with the
> KeePass-compatible `Database::merge` (`keepass` `_merge` feature) — strictly
> better than pure file-LWW, and still protocol-compatible — then persisted.
> The merge tolerates same-modification-time divergences (which abort the raw
> keepass merge): such ties are broken in favour of the **incoming** copy by
> nudging its timestamp, then retried, so a push always applies cleanly.
> The signaling WebSocket runs **natively in Rust** via
> `tauri-plugin-websocket` (driven from `lib/webrtc.ts` through its JS API),
> because the WebView2 socket can hang in CONNECTING or be blocked by the app
> CSP / Windows network stack; the native client (rustls) connects reliably.
> Only the `RTCPeerConnection` stays in the WebView. The `websocket:default`
> capability is granted in `capabilities/default.json`, and `connect-src` in
> `tauri.conf.json` is still broadened (`ws: wss: stun: turn:`) for the WebRTC
> ICE paths. Snapshots are normalized to the **Argon2d** KDF and **AES-256**
> cipher for the widest reader compatibility: `kdbxweb` (the mobile app) rejects
> Argon2id's UUID and keepass-rs's non-standard KDBX4 AES-KDF UUID (7c02bb82…)
> as "bad KDF", and doesn't support Twofish — so Argon2id/AES-KDF → Argon2d and
> Twofish → AES-256 on export, while the local on-disk vault keeps its own
> settings. Each data-channel message is also kept under 16 KiB. The
> one remaining requirement for a successful merge: the vault **filename must
> match** across devices (the node's `KDBX_FILENAME` = the desktop vault's
> basename), since peers identify a shared vault by filename. Backend logic is
> covered by 5 Rust unit tests.

## 📊 Success Criteria by Phase

| Phase | Success Criteria |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | App launches, shows window, tray icon works |
| 2 | Can open sample KDBX files, Argon2 unlocks < 1s |
| 3 | Can create/edit/delete entries and groups |
| 4 | Attachments work, history restores, templates populate |
| 5 | Password generator creates strong passwords, OTP codes match mobile |
| 6 | Search finds entries in < 100ms, auto-type fills credentials |
| 7 | All settings persist across restarts |
| 8 | Can sync with mobile app over local network |
| 9 | Can import from 1Password CSV, browser extension connects |
| 10 | All tests pass, signed installer created |

## 🚧 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| keepass-rs limitations | Maintain fork or contribute patches upstream |
| WebRTC complexity | Start with simple file transfer, iterate on conflict resolution |
| Windows API changes | Use stable Win32 APIs, not preview features |
| Performance with large DBs | Implement virtualization early, profile with 50k+ entries |
| Code signing delays | Obtain certificate in Phase 8, not at release |

---

## 📝 Notes

- All KDBX operations must maintain compatibility with KeePass 2.x and VaultPeerMobile
- UI/UX patterns should mirror mobile app where applicable for consistency
- Performance target: Unlock in < 1s, search in < 100ms, UI at 60fps
- Security: No network calls except explicit P2P sync, no telemetry
